P07 - Aim 2 Core Microbiome

Nov 11, 2024

Purpose
To generate venn-diagram plot of core microbiome on the four combined conditions of smoking status and disease condition, using previously generated phyloseq object.

Material
taxonomy.tsv, table.qzv, tree.nwk, ryan_metadata.tsv or previously generated phyloseq object

Method
Subset the data into 4 groups (Crohn's Disease/Smoker, Crohn's Disease/Non-smoker, Ulcerative Colitis/Smoker, Ulcerative Colitis/Non-smoker)
The detection is set to 0.01 (1% relative abundance) in order to filter out rare things and only consider those that are somewhat abundant.
The prevalence threshold is set to 0.65 in order to see differences between groups which means it  has to be present in 65% of samples in that group to be considered.

Output files:
Core Microbiome core_microbiome.png

Results:
All output files are in the file path: project 2/Aim 2/. CD and UC smokers exhibited unique core microbes, whereas non-smokers lacked distinct core microbiota.
It revealed 5 and 6 unique core microbes for UC and CD smokers, respectively, while non-smokers did not exhibit any

Discussion/Future Direction:
These significant unique core microbes prompt further investigation to determine differentially abundant microbes using ANCOM for Aim 3. 
It suggests that smoking may affect microbial composition with respect to different disease conditions, UC or CD.
