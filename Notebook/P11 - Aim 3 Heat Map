P13 - Aim 3 Heat Map

Nov 12, 2024

Purpose
To measure gut microbial diversity and composition in IBD patients combined with their smoking stauts in different colon regions, using Alpha diversivty index of Shannon.

Material
ryan_metadata_new.tsv
taxonomy.tsv
feature-table.txt
tree.nwk

Method
Subset the data into 4 different groups (UC or CD / Smoker or Non_smoker). Assign alpha diversity values to each sample (Shannon) and plot using geom_tile from ggplot2. 


R Script: 
Path: project 2/Aim 3/Heat_map.R

Results:
In CD patients, smokers exhibited greater microbial diversity compared to non-smokers in the ascending, descending, and right colon but showed lower diversity in the transverse colon. 
In UC patients, smokers exhibited lower microbial diversity compared to non-smokers in the sigmoid colon. 
These findings highlight region-specific differences in microbial diversity associated with smoking status and disease condition.

Discussion/Future Direction:
Smoking impacts microbial diversity more significantly in CD patients than in UC patients. 
The observed differences in microbial diversity across colon regions emphasize the complexity the interactions within the gut and their potential relevance to disease pathology.

Future work should investigate the mechanisms underlying these region-specific changes in microbial diversity and how they relate to disease progression or treatment response. 
Functional profiling of the microbes in different colon regions could shine light on how smoking modulates microbiota in CD and UC patients. 
Expanding the sample size and conducting longitudinal studies would help validate these findings and uncover effects of smoking on gut microbiota.
