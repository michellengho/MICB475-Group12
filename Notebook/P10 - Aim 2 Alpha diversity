P10 - Aim 2 Alpha diversity

Nov 12, 2024

Purpose
To measure gut microbial diversity and composition in IBD patients combined with their smoking stauts, using Alpha diversivty indices of Shannon, Faith's PPhylogenetic Diversity, 
Observed Features, and Chao1.

Material
ryan_metadata_new.tsv
taxonomy.tsv
feature-table.txt
tree.nwk

Method
Subset the data into 4 different groups (UC or CD / Smoker or Non_smoker). Assign alpha diversity values to each sample (Shannon, Faith's PPhylogenetic Diversity, Observed Features, 
and Chao1) and plot using geom_boxplot from ggplot2. Shapiro test was used to determine data normality. 
Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Wilcoxon rank sum test with Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction were used to test significance of each indices.

Results:
All output files are in the file path: project 2/Aim 2/. Chao1 and Observed features showed significance between UC and CD non-smokers, with a p-value of 0.012 for both 
(wilcoxon rank sum test with Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction). p-values greater than 0.5 for the rest of the tests (both Kruskal-wallis and Wilcoxon)

Discussion/Future Direction:
Significant differences in microbial richness (Chao1 and Observed Features) between UC and CD non-smokers (p = 0.012). 
This suggests that the underlying disease condition affects microbial richness in non-smokers. However, no significant differences were observed for smokers or the other indices.
Hypothesis: Smoking may introduce variability that masks condition-specific differences. 

Since DESeq2 and beta diversity analyses (Bray-Curtis, unweighted UniFrac, and weighted UniFrac) failed to identify distinct patterns or core differences 
in microbial taxa or community composition between UC and CD non-smokers, future work should focus on other tools to uncover variations driving the observed richness differences.
Investigating how smoking alters microbial composition and potentially masks condition-specific patterns could provide further insights. 
Expanding the sample size or conducting longitudinal studies may help detect shifts in microbial diversity and functionality.
Future analysis should use Dunn's test for more robust post hoc pairwise comparisons.
