P01 - QIIME 2 Demultiplexing

Sep 24, 2024

Purpose
To import and sort the 16S rRNA sequences based on barcode information in QIIME2

Material
    QIIME2
    ryan_manifest.tsv (Path in server:/mnt/datasets/project_2/human_ibd/ryan_manifest.tsv )

Method:

    Connect to Cisco Anyconnect Secure VPN. Open the terminal and login to MICB 475 class server using the provided login credentials.
    Create a dedicated directory for project 2: /data/project2_data
    Import and demultiplex the provided manifest data
    Create a visualization for the demultiplexed samples
    Move the demux.qzv file to your local computer directory and view it using the QIIME 2

Code

Output files:

    Path in server: /data/project2_data/demux_seqs.qza
    Path in server: /data/projecy2_data/demux_seqs.qzv

Results

The same result is generated from samples sequenced from both forward and reverse primers

    Total number of reads: 19263044
    Total number of samples: 343
    Range of sequencing depth: 53354.0-238445
    Maximum read length (bp): 300
    All the reads the same length of 300 bp

Discussion:

    The maximum read depth (bp) was 300 while all 343 samples (the same number of samples using both forward and reverse primers) had 300 bp in length.
    After demultiplexing, the quality score experiences fall towards the end (esp reverse), hence truncation is necessary

Future direction:
Denoise sequences using the selected truncation length of 220 bp (median phred score 34) and determine ASVs with DADA2 (outputs: table.qza, stats.qza, rep-seqs.qza)

    Selected truncation length of 280, 214, 140, 300 prior and all did not work out
