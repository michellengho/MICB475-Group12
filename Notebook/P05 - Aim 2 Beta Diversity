P03 - QIIME 2 Alpha Rarefaction, Human-Readable File Export

Nov 18, 2024

Purpose
To generate PcoA graph for beta analysis using bray-curtis, unweighted Unifrac, and weighted unifrac distance and perform pairwise PERMANOVA to test their significance

Material

R studio
ryan_final_rarefied,.RData

Method:

    Subset the data to only contain information for aim2 BETA diversity (UC smoker, UC non-smoker, CD smoker, CD non-smoker)


Code

Output files:

Results

All output fles in /project 2/Aim 2/
PAIRWISE permanova test revealed that all conditions were significant using BC distance, but not significant using W and UW

Discussion:

In the PCOA plot generated using unweighted unifrac distance,  non-smokers exhibitted overlapping clusters while the smokers exhibitted distinct clusters. 

Future direction:
Include the graph within the presentation and explain the finding
