P03 - QIIME 2 Alpha Rarefaction, Human-Readable File Export

Nov 16, 2024

Purpose
To generate create phyloseq object and filter out the Mitochondria/Chloroplast Sequence

Material

R Studio
taxonomy.tsv
feature-table.txt
ryan_metadata_new.tsv

Method:

    Create a project within R studio for dedicated R works (475_project)
    Import the taxonomy.tsv, feature-table.txt, and ryan_metadata_new.tsv and format them apropriately to generate a phyloseq object
    Filter out the chloroplast and mitochondria
    Remove any ASV with less than 5 counts
    Rarify samples

Output files:

ryan_final_rarefied,.RData

Results

Generated files were zipped and sent to teammates for downstream analysis

Discussion:

Phyloseq object is kept consistently for downstream analysis
   
Future direction:
alpha/beta diversity analysis for Aim1/2, Core microbiome analysis for aim 3
