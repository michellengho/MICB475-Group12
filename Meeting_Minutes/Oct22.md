## Meeting Notes
- Start looking at the data and assign action items
- Observed features could be plotted for richness
- Q: Remember the feature classification QIIME code from last week, it doesn’t work because it doesn’t have a reverse option
- A: Having 2 truncation lengths is unusual: review  step and potentially redo QIIME-2 pipeline at truncation length of 140 (shorter of the 2)
