Checked draft powerpoint with Chris and Evelyn

Aim 1:
Filter out the unknown only (keep ex-smokers)

Aim 2: 

Adjustion to make:
1. Doing a 4 channel plot instead of putting all the condition on a single plot
2. Come up with a way to make the quantity more obvious because it's hard to tell how muc smokers and non-smokers are in  the current plot 

Explained the nature of the team meeting, there will be 10 minutes of coaching, the mark of the presentation would be based on how well the basic understanding of the module/teaching is conveyed


For next week:
Michelle, Wei-Wei and Amy perform DESeq2 on Michelle's core microbiome analysus
Adrian and Sherin generate the two heat maps

Further boxplot and plot refinement suggestion would be given out next week
