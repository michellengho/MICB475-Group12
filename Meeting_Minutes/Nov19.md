## Meeting Agenda
- Review collection of figures on powerpoint
- Ask about figure formatting and which to include

## Meeting Notes
- Checked draft powerpoint with Chris and Evelyn
- Aim 1: Filter out the unknown only (keep ex-smokers)
- Aim 2: Adjustments to make:
1. Doing a 4 channel plot instead of putting all the condition on a single plot
2. Come up with a way to make the quantity more obvious because it's hard to tell how muc smokers and non-smokers are in  the current plot 

- Explained the nature of the presentation, there will be 10 minutes of coaching, the mark of the presentation would be based on how well the basic understanding of the module/teaching is conveyed

## Action Items
- Michelle, Wei-Wei, and Amy perform DESeq2 on Michelle's core microbiome analysis by next week
- Arian and Sherin generate the two heat maps
- Boxplot and plot refinement suggestions would be given out next week
