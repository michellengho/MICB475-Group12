Aim 1 Confirmed

Aim 2: 

Adjustion to make:
1. Doing a 4 channel plot instead of putting all the condition on a single plot
2. Come up with a way to make the quantity more obvious because it's hard to tell how muc smokers and non-smokers are in  the current plot 

Explained the natre of the team meeting, there will be 10 minutes of coaching, the mark of the presentation would be based on how well the basic understanding of the module/teaching is conveyed

For next week, should have the DeSEQ and heat map reading, further boxplot and plot refinement suggestion would be given out next week
