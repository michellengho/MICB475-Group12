# MICB475-Group12

## 2024-Sep-24

**Propose a concrete research question**
- IBD in humans is a good dataset as it has not been used by many groups
- Compare different contexts (ie., Halfvarson contains more body sites while Ryan only investigates the colon; combine the datasets and compare across body sites)
- Ryan dataset is good in that one could compare microbial differences at different locations on the body, investigate inflammation, etc.
    Quality control has not been done - no manifest file
- Work alongside Chris while initially handling this dataset

**Create a list of aims for the overall project**
- It is not necessary to meet all of the goals set for the project
- May set higher expectations but not fulfill all of them

**Q&A**
- 10-15 samples per category (minimum 3) - recognize limits in limitation section
- Metadata analysis: examine p values for significance - more statistics/modeling, less biological interpretation - significant results are not required
